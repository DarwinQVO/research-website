# Security Policy

## Enterprise Security Implementation

This project implements enterprise-level security measures:

### ‚úÖ Security Features Implemented

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Strict CSP headers preventing XSS attacks
   - Allowlisted domains for external resources
   - Frame ancestors blocked to prevent clickjacking

2. **HTTP Security Headers**
   - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) with 1-year max-age
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

3. **Input Sanitization**
   - All form inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS
   - HTML tags and JavaScript removed from user input
   - Form data cleared after successful submission

4. **Privacy Protection**
   - Google Analytics configured with IP anonymization
   - Secure cookie flags (SameSite=Strict;Secure)
   - Cross-origin policies implemented

5. **Environment Security**
   - Sensitive credentials moved to environment variables
   - Example environment file provided
   - .env.local excluded from version control

### üîí Security Headers Applied

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; img-src 'self' data: https: blob:; connect-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com https://api.airtable.com; frame-ancestors 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Security (Cloudflare)

When deploying to Cloudflare Pages:

1. Enable additional security features:
   - Bot Fight Mode
   - DDoS protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Geographic restrictions if needed

2. Configure environment variables securely:
   - Set AIRTABLE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in Cloudflare dashboard
   - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID in Cloudflare dashboard
   - Never commit these values to the repository

### üìù Security Checklist

- [x] HTTPS enabled (automatic with Cloudflare)
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] Input sanitization implemented
- [x] Environment variables secured
- [x] Dependencies audited (no vulnerabilities)
- [x] CSP headers preventing XSS
- [x] Clickjacking protection
- [x] Privacy-compliant analytics

### üö® Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do not open a public issue
2. Email security concerns privately
3. Allow time for assessment and patching before disclosure

### üìã Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Monthly**: Run `npm audit` to check for dependency vulnerabilities
2. **Quarterly**: Review and update security headers
3. **Annually**: Rotate API keys and tokens
4. **As needed**: Update CSP when adding new external resources

This security implementation provides enterprise-level protection suitable for production deployment with global availability.
